        <p> This is Hrithvik Sharma's website.</p>

          <p>Everyone says that you should persue a career based on your comfort zone, but sometimes things get out of your hand. I'm saying so because in this short period of time I've realised that majority of time thing's doesn't go the way you want them to be.
          Many people dream of being Astronaut, Actor, etc, but for as long as I can remember, I wanted to be in Armed forces specially in Indian Airforce.
          It was my childhood dream to fly a supersonic jet (one that can travel faster than the speed of sound). Due to this I started building my career in this direction. Every step that I took whether it be (Educational, Physical) was somehow influenced to take me in this direction.</p>
          <p> My craze of working in "Indian Armed Forces" quadrupled in 10th standard when my elder brother cleared the enterance exam of NDA(National Defence Academy). The only institute where students are trained to be Officers with a zeal of doing something great, achieving things that no ordinary guy can do.
          And I started preparing myself for this even more. In the due period of time, I applied for the enterance exam of NDA, and due to some reasons didn't get selected.
          The time was way to harsh for me, as I were clueless. Didn't know a thing, multiple questions crossed my mind.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What if I'm not good enough?</li>
            <li>Why did this happen to me?</li>
            <li>What should a do next?</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This was the time I realised, everything that you dream of doesn't come true. So be brave, hold onto the small things that make you smile. As time doesn't stop for no-one, you have to stand up against every odd and beat them in their face.
             This was the time of self realization. Never lose hope.</p>
          <p> Thankyou all for bearing my story. </p>
